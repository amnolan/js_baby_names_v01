# js_baby_names_v01
A baby names API lookup. The API URI is obscured. The results are based on an actual data set from a baby names index from the government. 

The code dynamically creates graph elements and spaces them appropriately. It assigns a respective height to signify the commonality of the name for that year group. The UI was entirely built by hand (no starter code, no example code, no bootstrap) using knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It then clears and refreshes the graph for each different name selected. Implemented primarily in JavaScript. It also provides information about the name, if any exists. In some (rare) cases, it will display error messages.
